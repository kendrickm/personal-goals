### Week in Review
This week was a deep breath in the personal goal process. I gave myself very simple goals,
and ironically enough(not that ironic) I was able to complete them. I'd like to end next week,
which also ends Q1, on a note of reflection and review of my year goals. By next week I'm
hoping to determine what steps I should make to actually accomplish what I want to do this year.
