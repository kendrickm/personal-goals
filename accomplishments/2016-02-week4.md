### Week in Review
At the end of this week, I went to a party. At this party were a lot of friends I
hadn't seen in a long time. As because of that, a lot of the conversations were
"so, whats new with you?" or "What are you up to lately" and it occurred to me that
I tended towards the boring. "Oh not much, work and such like it is"  I would reply.
Not untrue either, which is what struck me the most. So I'm wanting more and more to make
every day count.
