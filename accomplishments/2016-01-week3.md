### Week in Review
This was a week of todo lists gone horribly wrong. I didn't think to look at my schedule for the week and found myself extremely overwhelmed. Didn't go to the gym like I wanted, felt too exhausted to do much of anything. The idea of an additional todo list on top of this all was unnecessary stress. For next week I'll be keeping a better handle on my schedule
